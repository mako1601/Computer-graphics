# Computer graphics
Computer Graphics lab work will be posted in this repository.

## System requirements
- Cmake 3.25+
- OpenGL 4.6
- Windows 10, 11 (other OS have not been tested)

## Task
### Second lab*
Implement transformations of a figure on a plane:
- translation
- scaling
- reflection
- rotation

\* â€“ I decided not to post the first work, the functions used for it are in [DrawFuntions](
https://github.com/mako1601/Computer-graphics/blob/master/lab%202/src/DrawFuntions.h).

### Third lab
Create a parallel oblique projection onto a plane parallel to Oxy.
User can switch between top view, front view, right view and visual projection.
